        "Machine Learning is one of the most emerging and powerful technology in today's era. The last few decades have seen a tremendous rise in 'Data', and it is of no use if we cannot find patterns hidden within it. Machine Learning helps find these patterns in a simpler way. Supervised Learning is one of Machine Learning's most common approach in which the computer learns from the data given to it to classify new observations. A major supervised learning problem is Image classification \n",
